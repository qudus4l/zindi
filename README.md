- **Context-Aware**: Considers nurse experience levels and facility types
- **Kenyan Healthcare Focus**: Handles local medical terminology and practices

## üéØ Technical Constraints

- **Model Size**: < 1 billion parameters
- **Inference Time**: < 100ms per vignette
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB RAM during inference
- **Target Hardware**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent edge device

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Training Samples**: 400 clinical vignettes with nurse responses
- **Test Samples**: 100 vignettes for evaluation
- **Average Response Length**: ~110 words
- **Clinical Domains**: Emergency care (46.8%), Infectious diseases (44.5%), Pediatrics (36.2%)
- **Geographic Coverage**: Primarily Uasin Gishu, Kakamega, and Kiambu counties
